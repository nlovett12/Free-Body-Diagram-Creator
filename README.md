This project *actually is updated*!!! (Link to play on browser: https://nl1234.itch.io/physics-simulator)

This project was inspired by my dad, who is a high school physics teacher. He would often complain about the lack of versatile resources, and I decided to take a shot at remedying it. 
So, this project is a Free-Body-Diagram-Creator! It uses Python and the Pygame library to create a simulation similar to real life. 

Unless you turn it off, gravity applies as normal, along with any forces you choose to apply! 

Among other features, there are: 
- forces at any angle
- Fnet, available if you so choose
- elastic/inelastic collisions (a little finicky, but they work (: )
- friction (also available if you so choose, since the coefficient is changeable!)
- customizable masses, (initial) velocities, and more
- a formula tab (partially for usefulness, partially to hide data/answers from students)
